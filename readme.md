## 3. Installation

SysTools is available via the [GetIt Package Manager](http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/en/Installing_a_Package_Using_GetIt_Package_Manager) where you can quickly and easily install and uninstall it.

To manually install TurboPack SysTools into your IDE, take the following
steps:

  1. Unzip the release files into a directory (e.g., d:\systools).

  2. Start RAD Studio.

  3. Add the source subdirectory (e.g., `d:\systools\source`) to the
     IDE's library path. For CBuilder, add the hpp subdirectory
     (e.g., `d:\systools\source\hpp\Win32\Release`) to the IDE's system include path.

  4. Open & install the designtime package specific to the IDE being
     used. The IDE should notify you the components have been
     installed.

## 4. Issue with C++Builder under Win64

If you compile with C++Builder under Win64 and receive an error like:

`[ilink64 Error] Error: Unresolved external 'vtable for...`

you should add the following lines to your cpp file:

```cpp
#ifdef _WIN64
#pragma comment(lib, "%packagename%")
#endif
```
